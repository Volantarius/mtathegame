# Multi Theft Auto: The Game
Just a little example gamemode I made for MTA years ago. Putting this up for archival.
Gamemode based of The Game from the ARMA group ShackTac. I have no relations with the group.

Again pretty old, not so much mistake wise just my knowledge of Lua was pretty small back then.

# Installation

Place both 'thegame' and 'tg_testmap' in your MTA server's resources folder. Run a server and switch to 'thegame' gamemode.
Finally play the map 'tg_testmap'. Everything here should give you a good example for setup and what not.
